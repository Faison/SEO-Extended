SEO-Extended
============

A WordPress plugin for viewing and editing all Yoast SEO Titles on one page and Meta Descriptions on another. Download the latest stable release and view the full description in the WordPress Plugin Directory: http://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-extended/

I put the code here on GitHub to allow people to make pull requests if that's their preferred method of feedback. In fact, if someone is good at these README.md files, definitely send me a pull request with a nicer version of this :D
